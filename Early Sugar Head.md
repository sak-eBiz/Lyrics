# Early Sugar Head  
### a.k.a. *Pistachio Girl*

**Song / Lyrics:** Sakura Miyake

&nbsp;

### Verse 1

Early sugar head  
This can’t be in my mind  
Breathing neon in my …  
Humming cold voices  

This can’t be in my head  
Echoes in an empty room  
While everyone's half awake, ah  
They’re playing plastic songs  

Early sugar head  
This can’t be in my mind  
Breathing neon from my bed  

&nbsp;

*— Instrumental —*

&nbsp;

### Chorus 1

I've fully awakened, I am fully awake now,  
I’ve been fully awakened,  
I am walking through the peppermint sea  

My mind is like a melting stereo  
This can’t be in my eyes  
Though it is only the dead night  
Casting out a tangible phantom  

Waking in the silent hum of someone else’s dream  
I'm displaced  

&nbsp;

*— Guitar Solo —*

&nbsp;

### Pre-Chorus

While everyone's half awake, ah  
They’re playing plastic songs  
Early sugar head  
This can’t be in my mind  
Breathing neon from my… That can’t be there!

&nbsp;

*— Instrumental (Bass) —*

&nbsp;

### Chorus 2

I've fully awakened, I am fully awake now,  
I’ve been fully awakened,  
I am walking through the peppermint sea  

My mind is like a melting stereo  
This can’t be in my soul  
Still it is only that freaking night  
Haunting me with someone’s nonsense  

Reaching out those flickering phantoms  
Fading into myths  
I'm misplaced  

&nbsp;

### Chorus 3

I've fully awakened, I am fully awake now,  
I’ve been fully awakened,  
I am walking through the peppermint sea  

My mind is like a melting stereo…

&nbsp;
